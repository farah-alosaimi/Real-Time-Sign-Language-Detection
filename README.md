# Real Time Sign Language Detection with Tensorflow Object Detection and Python | Deep Learning SSD

build an end-to-end custom object detection model that allows you to translate sign language in real time into text. 

STEPS
1. Collect images for deep learning using your webcam and OpenCV
2. Label images for sign language detection using LabelImg
3. Setup Tensorflow Object Detection pipeline configuration
4. Use transfer learning to train a deep learning model
5. Detect sign language in real time using OpenCV
